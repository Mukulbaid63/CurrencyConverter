## Points to keep in mind while contributing:
- Issues will be assigned on a first come, first serve basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit and complete the issue within 7 days.
- Preferably, you cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue, describing in details your improvement. This will help others to analyze your contribution. You can use the templates that we have provided :)
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR.
- Add a screenshot of the output in the PR's description after the changes you have made.

 ## How to start ? 🎪


#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository 🚀

This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository 🏁

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

```


## Create a branch ⚓

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes 🚏

Do the necessary changes.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "(Add your message here)"
```

replacing `<Add your message here>` with your message.

## Push changes to GitHub 🪂

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

replacing `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review 🚩

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.
